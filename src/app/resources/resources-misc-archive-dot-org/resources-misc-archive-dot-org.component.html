                <p>If you have ten or fifteen minutes to kill, <a href="http://www.archive.org">Archive.org</a> is an awesome website – it’s one of my favorites. One of its coolest features is the Wayback Machine. It allows you to visit practically any website as it looked on various dates in time.</p>

                <p>You can search some of your favorite brands, like Amazon.com. For example, if you go to October 17, 2000 you will see that you could have visited Amazon Auctions! Or on November 15, 2004 you could have gotten a copy of National Lampoons Christmas Vacation DVD for the low price of 7.99 delivered! </p>

                <p>Buying a domain can be an easy or a daunting task especially if you are not sure what to do or how to do it. Before we get into the acquisition process answer me this…Have you decided what domain you would like to purchase or are you still trying to figure it out? If you are still on the fence might I suggest you read this article: <a routerLink="/resources/why">Why Purchase a Domain Name?</a></p>
