          and a domain name?</h2>
        <p>
          A website is a collection of webpages on the Internet that contain content. A domain name is essentially the
          virtual address or location of a website.
          An easy way to think of the relationship is to think of a domain name like a piece of real estate property and
          to think of a website like a business
          that operates on the property. Just like in real estate, a domain can lie vacant just like a property. Or it
          can be occupied by a website. And just as
          a business needs a physical property in order to operate, a website needs a domain name in order to operate. A
          domain name can exist without a website,
          but a website cannot exist without a domain name.

        <p>
          There are many benefits to having your own domain name for your business. If you plan on having any presence
          online, you should invest in a domain name.
          First and foremost, a domain allows for much more control over your online presence than any social media
          platform can offer. With a domain, you control
          branding, look and feel, search engine positioning, etc. All of this control makes it easier for reach
          potential customers. The most important part of
          having your own website instead of relying on a 3rd party is you own the content. When you post to a social
          media site you give them ownership of it.
          That means you could lose access to it without notice.

        <h2 class="faq-title-gradient-secondary my-0" id="do-i-need">Do I need a domain to have a website?</h2>
        <p>
          To put it simply – yes, you need a domain name to have a website. You can build a website, but unless that
          website is connected to a domain name, no
          one on the Internet will be able to access the site. The domain name is essentially the website’s virtual
          location. Without a domain name, the website
          cannot “exist” anywhere on the Internet.<br>
          You can build a website using a service such as Wix or WordPress, but unless you pay to register your own
          domain, you have to use the Wix or WordPress
          domain at the end of your site’s URL. We do not suggest you do that for multiple reasons.<br>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You might not own the registration of the domain. If you become reliant to that domain a third party could
            raise your renewals or keep your content. It is not a great position to be in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a long or cheap looking domain does not sit well with clients. It would be better to register a .COM,
            .CO, .NET, or .INC for example and own it outright for a mere 10-20 dollars a year.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="faq-title-gradient-secondary my-0" id="can-i-host">Can I host my own domain, or do I need a domain
          hosting service?</h2>
        <p>
          Yes. It is possible to host your own domain. However, unless you are technically inclined and want to spend
          unnecessary time and effort,
          we recommend using a hosting service. Hosting your own domain is a complicated, multi-step process that will
          yield a more expensive,
          sub-standard product compared to what you will get with a hosting service. <br>
          Put another way, hosting your own website is a bit like making your own puff pastry from scratch instead of
          using store-bought. Unless
          you’re a professional pastry chef, you’re going to spend a lot of time and effort on a pastry that probably
          won’t even taste as good as
          something made with inexpensive store-bought puff pastry.

        <p>
          SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Before diving into SEO, we need to talk about search engines. All
          major search engines like Google
          and Bing rank search results based on what the search engine decides is most relevant for each user. Think of
          search engines like extremely
          sophisticated librarians. They are able to sift through millions and millions of pages of information to
          provide useful and relevant information
          to its users. They “decide” what is relevant through an algorithm that sifts through the information based on
          key words.
          If you have a website and wish to reach as many customers as possible, search engine results are crucial. The
          higher your website is ranked on
          Google searches relevant to your industry, to more web traffic you will receive from potential customers. This
          is where Search Engine Optimization
          (SEO) comes in. Essentially, SEO involves developing content that is relevant to your industry that will work
          with the search engine algorithm
          to produce higher search results.

          One key to maximizing Search Engine Optimization (SEO) lies in your domain name. Keep the following SEO tips
          in mind for domain names:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your budget allows, stick to .com top-level domains – they generate the most credibility of all top-level
            domains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your name short and memorable. Search engines use accessibility as a ranking factor, so the easier your
            domain name is for humans to read and understand, the higher search engines will rank your site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid hyphens, numbers, non-standard characters, etc. Domains like balloons-direct543.biz come across as
            unprofessional and will be less likely to be ranked on search engines.

        <p>
          As mentioned in many questions before one can register a domain name for as little as 10 to 20 dollars per
          year. When it comes to the most
          common extensions the best domain names are taken. Hand registering a domain for your product or company name
          strategically does not make sense.
          Why is that? This domain is your online identity, it is your brand, and it is what you are relying on to bring
          you new and repeat customers.
          Since most of the most premium and memorable domains are already taken you will be forced to register a very
          long domain or one with hyphens.
          Both options are easily misspelled or forgettable. A bare minimum of 2,000 USD should be spent on your domain
          if you are serious about your business.

          Yes. Most website builders like Wix or Wordpress offer domain purchasing and hosting services. A service they
